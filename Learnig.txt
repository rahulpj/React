We can return only one html element in jsx so we wrap it inside fragment and empty tag
In Vite it is maditory to name a file with .jsx extension
We need to keep the names of all the components starting with capital letter
It is good convention to keep all the components file starting with the capital letter

In vite index.js script is added to index.html using script tag
React is a library not a framework and it is a single page application(only one html file that is index.html)


why we need hooks?

suppose we are using the same variable in 4 to 5 Ui components so when the value of variable changes we need select all those components with the help of DOM and change everywhere no here comes the use of react we simply use the state varibles and hooks that are provided by react we just change the values as per our needs and react takes care of the changes in the UI component.
